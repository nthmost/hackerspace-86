==============

The "86 List" at Noisebridge consists of an informal repository of information
about various people who have proven themselves to be disruptive or dangerous
to the community -- in some cases violently dangerous.

We use this information internally to allow the Noisebridge community to maintain
an organizational memory so we don't have repeat bad experiences.

We seek to share this information broadly, in hopes that it helps other 
communities improve their own cultural immune systems.

This project aims to provide an API and (later) a web interface for
querying for and submitting this type of information.
